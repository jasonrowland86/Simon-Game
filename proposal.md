# Simon-Game Proposal

The classic Simon game. I think the logic behind this game will be interesting
and challenging for me, but getting it right will be a big win for me and be
reassuring that I can do this stuff. I also want to make a game that I could style
similarly to my tic tac toe game so that they could possibly be linked later as
one item.

## Initial thoughts on game structure

I expect to be challenged with the randomization needed in the logic of this game.
I've also never used an interval or a timer for anything yet, this will be new.
And I plan to use some CSS animations to add to the experience.

## Phases of Completion

I expect the lay out to be fairly simple. The second and longest phase will be working on the logic.

Charles Kapps, who wrote most of the original code for Simon also taught computer
science and wrote one of the first books on the theory of computer programming.
I thought that was pretty interesting.
